A tiny inventory management web-application.


DESCRIPTION

	The API back-end for this application is written in `go'. It handles
	routes to perform CRUD operations on the inventory database (which
	is on `postgres') and also stores and manages dynamic thumbnail
	generated for the uploaded images. The front-end of the application
	is written in HTML and some JavaScript.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

	- client/*html
		HTML files to interact with the API backend.

	- db/*.sql
		Schema files for the database.

	- proxy/*
		Configuration files (`nginx') for the front-end proxy.

	- server/*.go
		API backend implementation. This is deployed as a `docker'
		image with the `Dockerfile' in the repository root.

	- docker-compose.yml
		Configuration file for `docker-compose' to pull, and build all
		the necessary `docker' images to start the application.

	- .env
		For environment variables.


HOW-TO

	To run the application, clone this repository and run:
		
		$ docker compose up --build

	... at the repository root. Note that this requires "docker" to be
	installed on the machine.
